# Ridge Estimation

The code used for the paper [`Dynamic Atomic Column Detection in Transmission Electron Microscopy Videos via Ridge Estimation`](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2025.3543138) published by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

It includes the main function for ridge estimation. In addition, it also includes the noise generating process given prefixed signal-to-noise level under Poisson type distribution.

For more details and examples of implementation, see the tutorial notebook [here](https://github.com/XycYuchenXu/Ridge-Estimation/blob/main/Tutorial.ipynb).

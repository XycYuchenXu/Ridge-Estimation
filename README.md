# Ridge Estimation

The code used for the paper `Dynamic Atomic Column Detection in Transmission Electron Microscopy Videos via Ridge Estimation` published by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

It includes the main function for ridge estimation. In addition, it also includes the noise generating process given prefixed signal-to-noise level under Poisson type distribution.

For more details and examples of implementation, see the tutorial notebook [here](https://github.com/XycYuchenXu/Ridge-Estimation/blob/main/Tutorial.ipynb).
